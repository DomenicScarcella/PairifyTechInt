# PairifyTechInt
PUBLIC git repository at GitHub for your environment and the code we will write together.

This was my technical challenge during my interview.  I completed the coding in Gitpod.io and copied the calc and test files to GitHub.

The challenge was to create a calculator function by doing Test Driven Development.  A total of 11 test cases were given to me, and I had to write the code in calc.js that would pass each test in order before proceeding to modify the calc.js code to pass the next test.

I didn't finish the challenge during the allotted interview time, but I saved the Gitpod workspace and went back to it to finish on my own time.  I did it!  All tests passed in Gitpod!
