# PairifyTechInt
This was my technical challenge during my interview with Byron at Pairify.  I completed the coding in Gitpod.io and copied the calc.js and calc.test.js files to GitHub.

The challenge was to create a calculator function by doing Test Driven Development.  A total of 11 test cases were given to me, and I had to write the minimum amount of code in calc.js that would pass the first test, before proceeding to modify the calc.js code to pass the next test, and so on.

I didn't finish the challenge during the allotted interview time, but I saved the Gitpod workspace and went back to it to finish it on my own time.  I did it!  All tests passed in Gitpod!
